# SwiftUI iOS 18 Tour
![rocket](/headerRocket.jpg)

## Getting Started
Use this companion app to tour the major additions to the SwiftUI framework which were added in iOS 18. Just clone or download this repo, and then open the Xcode project. From there, you can either run the app on your phone to reference it whenever you need, or you can view the entire experience using Xcode Previews. Either way!

## Contributing
We welcome any additions or APIs you'd like to see added. Simply open a pull request and we'd love to add your enhancements.
