You can detect changes in scrolling, sort of like how `contentOffset`, the contents size and more worked in UIKit and `UIScrollView`.\n\n2. You can be notified when a view became visible due to scrolling (or when it loses visibility).\n\n3. More programmatic control over scrolling, like scrolling to certain points or even edges.\n\nLet's take a look at scrolling to positions first. If you use a `Hashable` identifier, you could easily scroll to items in a list. Or, if you just want \"standard\" scrolling points, like the top or bottom â€” you can just pass in an `Int` type:")
